a. 


1, 2, 3, 4, 5     2k + 1 where k = 2


first = 0, last = 4
first = 1, last = 3
first = 2, last = 2 

generally,
final iteration:
first = floor(k + 1/2)
last = floor(k + 1/2)


b.

middle element to 0 because it swaps with itself?

c.

change loop stopping condition to be:
first < last

this stops the middle element from being accessed
which is what we want since we have nothing to swap
it with
